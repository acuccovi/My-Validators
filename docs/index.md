## Welcome to My Validators!

This is a collection of Java Validators used in my home and work project

### How to install

Simply add the maven dependency as follows

```xml
<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.github.acuccovi.validator/MyValidators -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.acuccovi.validator</groupId>
    <artifactId>MyValidators</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.1</version>
